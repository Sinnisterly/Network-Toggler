## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/4u0qfa4.png)

There wasn't a huge need for this program, but many people were saying how inconvenient it is to manually do it, so here it is.

* Your time should be focused on what you're doing, not toggling your network.
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over.

Of course, this is an entirely unnecessary program, but it was requested.

## Built With

This was coded primarily with C# and using the default WinFormsApp in Visual Studio 2022.

## Getting Started

=========================================
If you just want to use the program:
* Download the latest release and run the program as administrator
* Open the dropdown box and select the adapter you want to disable.  
* Click the "Select Adapter" button.
* Click "OK"
* Set the amount of time you want to disable the adapter for (I generally use 45 seconds)
* Click the "Set Time (seconds)" button.
* Click "OK"
* Click the "Disable Adapter" button.
** your adapter is now disabled! do not worry! **
* Click "OK" 
** your adapter will be disabled for the time set! do not worry! **
* A box will pop up telling you your adapter is re-enabled.
* Click "OK"
** repeat as many times as needed **

=========================================
If you would like to download the source to modify/build it yourself:
* Click the green "<> Code" button at the top of the repository.
* Click any of the options (we'll say clone with Visual Studio for simplicity).
* Allow Microsoft Handler to open Visual Studio.
* Input where you want it to clone.
* Click "Clone"
* Change "Debug" at the top to "Release" .
* Click "Build" at the top bar.
* Click "Build Solution".
** In the output window at the bottom it will tell you where it was built to ** 
* Refer to the beginning of this section to see steps to use the program.

=========================================
